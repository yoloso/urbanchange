# Measuring Urban Quality and Change Through the Detection of Physical Attributes of Decay


**We develop an index of urban quality and urban change based on Google Street 
View images of cities over time.** We train a
 [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model to detect features of
urban decay including graffiti, garbage, facade discoloration and damage, 
weeds, broken and covered windows, and potholes. We create vector representations
and indices at the street segment level by aggregating the incidence of each
object class and visualize these over time to identify dynamics of urban
change such as gentrification and neighborhood decay.
